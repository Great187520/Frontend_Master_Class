 Introduction to JavaScript

Understanding JavaScript and its role in web development
How to include JavaScript in HTML (internal vs. external scripts)
Setting up your development environment
1.2 Variables and Data Types

Declaring variables (var, let, const)
Understanding data types: strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, null, undefined
Type conversion and type coercion

Operators

Arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /, %)
Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=)
Comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
Logical operators (&&, ||, !)

&& = and
|| = or
! = not

x = x + 1
x += 1

x = x - 1
x -= 1

x == y

x === y

x != y
x = 4
y = 3

x !== y

Conditionals

if statements: Basic syntax and usage
else and else if statements: Extending conditional logic
Ternary operator for concise conditionals

    Loops

for loop: Syntax and practical examples
while loop: Syntax and practical examples
do...while loop: Syntax and practical examples
Loop control: break and continue

Functions and Events
3.1 Defining Functions

Function declaration and expression
Parameters and arguments
Return values
Arrow functions (ES6+)

Understanding the concept of events in the DOM
Adding event listeners to HTML elements
Example: element.addEventListener('click', function)
Removing event listeners
Example: element.removeEventListener('click', function)
Working with the event object and event properties (e.g., event.target, event.type)

Event Handling
Understanding Events and the Event-Driven Model:

Events in JavaScript are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser, such as clicks, form submissions, and mouse movements. Event handling is the process of capturing these events and executing some code in response.

Adding Event Listeners (click, mouseover, mouseout, etc.):

`function(event) {...}`:

Prevents the default form submission using event.preventDefault().
Retrieves the email value and the error message container.
Checks if the email is empty and sets the error message accordingly.
Uses a regular expression to validate the email format.
Displays an error 
message if the email format is invalid.
Clears the error message and proceeds if the email is valid.


    img.src = \https://placekitten.com/100/100?image=${Math.floor(Math.random() * 16)}`;`:

    This sets the src attribute of the image element to a URL that points to a random kitten image.
    Template Literal (\...${...}``):
    The backticks (\``) and ${}` syntax allow for embedding expressions within a string.
    Math.floor(Math.random() * 16):
    Math.random() generates a random number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusive).
    Multiplying by 16 scales this number to the range [0, 16).
    Math.floor rounds down to the nearest integer, resulting in a random integer between 0 and 15.
    This expression generates a random integer between 0 and 15, and it is embedded into the URL, resulting in one of 16 possible images from the placekitten.com service.
    img.addEventListener('click', () => { ... });:
    
    This attaches a click event listener to the image element.
    When the image is clicked, the code inside the arrow function (=> { ... }) is executed.
    lightboxImg.src = img.src;:
    
    lightboxImg refers to an existing image element within a lightbox (a modal or overlay for displaying images).
    This line sets the src attribute of the lightboxImg element to the same src as the newly created image. This ensures that when the new image is clicked, the lightbox displays the clicked image.
    lightbox.style.display = 'flex';:
    
    lightbox refers to the lightbox container element.
    This line sets the display style of the lightbox to flex, making it visible. The lightbox is assumed to be initially hidden (e.g., display: none).
    gallery.appendChild(img);:
    
    gallery refers to a container element (e.g., a <div>) where the images are displayed.
    This line appends the newly created image element (img) to the gallery, adding it to the DOM.
